# Generate Scala scale files from musical scales

Employing the musical scales defined in the Go module https://github.com/mikebharris/music/music this simple module
generates Scala scale files (.scl) that can be used in various music software applications.

The Scala Scale File Format is from https://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/scl_format.html and has the following
properties:

* The files are human-readable ASCII or 8-bit character text-files.
* The file type is .scl .
* There is one scale per file.
* Lines beginning with an exclamation mark are regarded as comments and are to be ignored.
* The first (non comment) line contains a short description of the scale, but long lines are possible and should not
  give a read error. The description is only one line. If there is no description, there should be an empty line.
* The second line contains the number of notes. This number indicates the number of lines with pitch values that follow.
  In principle there is no upper limit to this, but it is allowed to reject files exceeding a certain size. The lower
  limit is 0, which is possible since degree 0 of 1/1 is implicit. Spaces before or after the number are allowed.
* After that come the pitch values, each on a separate line, either as a ratio or as a value in cents. If the value
  contains a period, it is a cents value, otherwise a ratio. Ratios are written with a slash, and only one. Integer
  values with no period or slash should be regarded as such, for example "2" should be taken as "2/1". Numerators and
  denominators should be supported to at least 231-1 = 2147483647. Anything after a valid pitch value should be ignored.
  Space or horizontal tab characters are allowed and should be ignored. Negative ratios are meaningless and should give
  a read error.
* The first note of 1/1 or 0.0 cents is implicit and not in the files.
* Files for which Scala gives Error in file format are incorrectly formatted. They should give a read error and be
  rejected.

## Example

See the tests in `scale_test.go` for examples of generating Scala scale files. For example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"

	"github.com/mikebharris/music/music"
	"github.com/mikebharris/music/scala"
)

func main() {
	scale := music.NewPythagoreanScale()
	scalaFile := scala.NewScalaScaleFileFromScale("pythagorean-3-limit.scl", scale)
	for _, line := range strings.Split(scalaFile, "\n") {
		fmt.Println(line)
	}
}
```

Yields:

```
! pythagorean-3-limit.scl
! generated using github.com/mikebharris/music/scala
!
Pythagorean scale using 3-limit Pythagorean ratios.
